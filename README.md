# Schellings-Model
Racial segregation has always been a pernicious social problem in the United States. Although efforts have been made to desegregate our schools, churches, and neighborhoods, the U.S. continues to be segregated along racial and economic lines.  In 1971, American economist Thomas Schelling created an agent-based model that might help explain why segregation is so difficult to combat. His model of segregation showed that even when individuals (or "agents") didn't mind being surrounded or living by agents of a different race, they would still choose to segregate themselves from other agents over time! Although the model is quite simple, it gives a fascinating look at how individuals might self-segregate, even when they have no explicit desire to do so.
